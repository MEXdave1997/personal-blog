&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey all! So, I know this post isn't really related to the topics I really want to talk about, as it can get very touchy, but it is a topic that I feel I need to talk about as it does affect the future of America as a whole.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of Yesterday morning, it was announced by US Attorney General Jeff Sessions that the **Deffered Action for Childhood Arrivals** program, or **DACA** for short, has been terminated, and all current activity will be *"winding down"*. He also announced that Congress will have 6 months to pass legislation to keep DACA in place, and that if no legislation is passed, then the program will cease to exist entirely. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a DACA holder, I am very disappointed in this decision, despite the fact that I knew that this had to happen at some point. I would have loved to see the currently terminated program to exist, with thepressuring of Congress. This would have done the job of pressuring Congress while still allowing the current holders of the temporary permit to work/study without fear. Though, that honestly might be just me. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you all think? If you would like to comment on this issue, as a whloe, shoot me an email (which you can find in the About Page), and we can have a discussion about it. I will try to implement a comments section to the blog ASAP, so that we can all share our commentary right on the page, so stay tuned! :)
