# About the Author

Hi, My name is MEXdave. I am the builder of this site. I created it with the goal of sharing my experience learning to code with the world. 

This site and theme were originally built by Tania Rasica, from a tutorial that can be found [here][https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/]. I will edit this site to fit my own personal style, and will document any other projects I am working on as well. So please check back often, as posts will come soon.
